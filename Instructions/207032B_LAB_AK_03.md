>  **Note:** If you followed the suggestion in Module 1, "Extending the Configuration Manager infrastructure to support Internet-based and mobile devices," you created a Microsoft account in the _YourInitials-MMDDYY_@outlook.com format. For example, if your name is Don Funk and you created a Microsoft account on September 18, 2017, your account should be DF-091817@outlook.com. In this case, you should sign in as  **Sync@DF091817outlook.onmicrosoft.com**.

5. On the  **Microsoft Store for Business** page, click **Manage**. Click **Accept**. And then click **Manage** again.

6. In the navigation pane, click  **Products &amp; services**. In the details pane, verify that the  **Sway**,  **OneNote**,  **PowerPoint Mobile**,  **Excel Mobile**, and  **Word Mobile** apps show a status of Adding to your private store.

#### Task 4: Prepare for the next module
  
- At the end of the lab, shut down the virtual machines (VMs). However, don't revert the VMs, because you will need the current state for later modules.


>  **Result**: After finishing this exercise, you should have successfully deployed apps from Microsoft Store for Business by using Configuration Manager. You should also have managed licenses for apps in Microsoft Store for Business.
