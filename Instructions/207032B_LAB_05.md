# Module 5: Mobile device management by using Configuration Manager
# Lab: Managing mobile devices by using the Exchange Server connector
  
### Scenario
  
 Adatum Corporation has traditionally used Exchange Server on-premises and Exchange ActiveSync to provide mobile access to email. You decide to implement the Exchange Server connector to integrate the mobile devices into the Configuration Manager management scope. You also need to ensure that users can only use mobile devices that meet your policy requirements, so you will configure conditional access in Configuration Manager.


### Objectives
  
 After completing this lab, you should be able to:

- Configure permissions for Exchange integration.

- Install and configure the Exchange Server connector.

- Manage mobile devices using Configuration Manager and Exchange.

>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Intune and other cloud services referenced in the course. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Your instructor will provide you with the lab documentation.

### Lab setup
  
 Estimated time: 30 minutes

Virtual machines:  **20703-2B-LON-DC1-B**,  **20703-2B-LON-CFG-B**, and  **20703-2B-LON-EXCH1-B**

 Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

 For this lab, you will use the available virtual machine environment. Before you begin the lab, complete the following steps:

1. On the host computer, start  **Hyper-V Manager**.

2. In  **Hyper-V Manager**, click  **20703-2B-LON-DC1-B**, and then in the  **Actions** pane, click **Start**.

3. In the  **Actions** pane, click **Connect**. Wait until the virtual machine starts. 

4. Sign in with the following credentials: 

  - User name:  **Administrator**

5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for  **20703-2B-LON-CFG-B** and **20703-2B-LON-EXCH1-B**.



## Exercise 1: Configure permissions for Exchange integration
  
### Scenario
  
 Before you create the Exchange Server connector, the service account that the connector uses must be configured as an Exchange administrator. For users to be configured as an Exchange administrator, they must have a mailbox.

First name:  **CFGEXCHCONN**

Display name:  **CFGEXCHCONN**

Name:  **CFGEXCHCONN**

User logon name:  **CFGEXCHCONN**

New password and Confirm password:  **Pa55w.rd**

5. In the navigation pane, click  **permissions**.

6. Click  **Recipient Management**, and then click the  **Edit** (pencil) icon.
