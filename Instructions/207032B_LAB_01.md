# Module 1: Extending the Configuration Manager infrastructure to support Internet-based and mobile devices
# Lab A: Preparing for cloud integration
  
### Scenario
  
 Your organization is in the process of extending your existing infrastructure to support cloud-based services and MDM. When setting up the Azure subscription, you want to ensure that you do not have to configure a set of parallel user accounts. Directory syncing enables users to utilize one set of credentials to authenticate against on-premises Active Directory and Azure AD. Your first step is to sign up for an Azure subscription and to synchronize your Active Directory accounts with the cloud-based service.


### Objectives
  
 After completing this lab, you should be able to:

- Activate an Azure subscription.

- Configure and enable directory syncing.

>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Intune and other cloud services referenced in the course. Microsoft Learning updated the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Your instructor will provide you with the lab documentation.

4. Repeat steps 1 through 3, but on the  **Export Private Key** page, select **No, do not export the private key**. Configure the following options:

  - For the  **Export File Format**, select  **DER encoded binary X.509 (.CER)**.

  - Name the file  **C:\\AzureCertificate.cer**.

5. Close the  **certlm** window.


>  **Result**: After this exercise, you should have successfully created and exported the Azure management certificate to be used for cloud-based distribution points.


## Exercise 2: Setting up Azure and creating a cloud-based distribution point
  
### Scenario
  
 To install a cloud-based distribution point, you first need to upload the Azure management certificate by using the Azure Management portal. You will then use Configuration Manager to create the cloud-based distribution point in Azure.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Upload the Azure management certificate to Azure

2. Install a cloud-based distribution point

3. Distribute content to the cloud-based distribution point

4. Stop the cloud-based distribution point service

5. Prepare for the next module



#### Task 1: Upload the Azure management certificate to Azure
  
1. On  **LON-DC1**, open Internet Explorer, and then browse to  **https://portal.azure.com**. Sign in with the Microsoft account that is associated with your Azure trial subscription.

2. On the  **All Services** page, click **Subscriptions**.

3. On the  **Subscriptions** page, click your subscription and then click **Management certificates**.

4. Upload the new management certificate from **\\\\LON-CFG\\C$\\Azurecertificate.cer**.

5. Verify that the certificate has uploaded, and then make note of the  **SUBSCRIPTION ID**. Write down the subscription ID because you will need it for the next task.

6. Close Internet Explorer.



#### Task 2: Install a cloud-based distribution point
  
1. On  **LON-CFG**, start the  **Configuration Manager** console from the taskbar.

2. On the  **Administration** workspace, select the **Cloud Distribution Points** node.

3. Create a cloud distribution point by using the following options:

  - Subscription ID: Provide the subscription ID that you noted in the previous task.

  - Management Certificate:  **C:\\Azurecertificate.pfx** (password is **Pa55w.rd**)

  - Certificate file:  **C:\\Azurecertificate.pfx** (password is **Pa55w.rd**)

  - Alerts:
Storage alert threshold (GB):  **100**

Monthly transfer alert threshold (GB):  **50**

4. Monitor the progress by opening the  **CloudMgr.log** file at **C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Configuration Manager\\Logs**.

5. In the  **Configuration Manager** console, with **Cloud Distribution Points** selected, verify that **clouddp1.cloudapp.net** shows a status of **Ready**. This might take up to 10 minutes.

6. Open Internet Explorer, and then browse to https://portal.azure.com. Sign in with the Microsoft account that is associated with your Azure trial subscription.

7. In the Azure Portal, in the navigation pane, click  **All resources**. Make note of the  **Storage account (classic)** and **Cloud service (classic)** objects. These both relate to the cloud-based distribution point.

8. Click the  **Cloud service (classic)** object.

9. On the  **Cloud service (classic)** page, in the details pane, make note of the Site URL and Public IP addresses. The Site URL should be in the form of http:// _GUID_.cloudapp.net.



#### Task 3: Distribute content to the cloud-based distribution point
  
1. On  **LON-CFG**, switch to the  **Configuration Manager** console.

2. From the  **Applications** node on the **Software Library** workspace, distribute the XML Notepad 2007 application with the following options:

  - Distribution Point:  **CLOUDDP1.CLOUDAPP.NET**

3. On the  **Monitoring** workspace, monitor the distribution status of the XML Notepad 2007 application.



#### Task 4: Stop the cloud-based distribution point service
  
1. On  **LON-CFG**, switch to the  **Configuration Manager** console.

2. On the  **Administration** workspace, select the **Cloud Distribution Points** node.

3. In the details pane, right-click  **clouddp1.cloudapp.net**, and then click  **Stop Service**. Verify that the status shows  **Stopped**.

4. Close all open windows on  **LON-CFG**.

>  **Note:** You perform this task to minimize the resource cost that is allocated against your Azure trial subscription.


#### Task 5: Prepare for the next module
  
- At the end of the lab, shut down the VMs. However, do not revert the VMs, because you will need the current state for later modules.


>  **Result**: After this exercise, you should have successfully set up Azure and created a cloud-based distribution point.



## 
  
**Question** 
You have configured a cloud-based distribution point; however, your clients can't seem to resolve the name of the cloud-based service. What should you do?

**Question** 
To keep the cost of a cloud-based distribution point manageable, you need to ensure that only a maximum of 100 GB is stored on the cloud service. How can you ensure this?
