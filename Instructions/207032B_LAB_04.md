# Module 4: Managing Office 365 apps by using Configuration Manager
# Lab A: Preparing Office 365 for application deployment
  
### Scenario
  
 Your organization has decided to use Office 365 and utilize the benefits of cloud-based services such as Exchange, Skype, and Office 365 ProPlus. You already have a Microsoft Azure subscription that you want to use for Office 365. You decide to add Adam Hobbs as another global administrator. Adam will then be in charge of signing up for the Office 365 subscription.


### Objectives
  
 After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Sign up for a trial subscription of Office 365.

- Assign Office 365 ProPlus licenses to users.

>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Intune and other cloud services referenced in the course. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Your instructor will provide you with the lab documentation.

### Lab setup
  
 Estimated time: 30 minutes

Virtual machines:  **20703-2B-LON-DC1-A**,  **20703-2B-LON-CFG-A**, and  **20703-2B-LON-CL1-A**

 User name:  **Adatum\\Administrator**

 Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

 For this lab, you will use the available virtual machine (VM) environment. Before you begin the lab, you must complete the following steps:

1. On the host computer, start  **Hyper-V Manager**.

2. In Microsoft Hyper-V Manager, click  **20703-2B-LON-DC1-A**, and then in the Actions pane, click  **Start**.

3. In the Actions pane, click  **Connect**. Wait until the VM starts. 

4. Sign in by using the following credentials: 

  - User name:  **Administrator**

  - Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

  - Domain:  **Adatum**

5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 for  **20703-2B-LON-CFG-A** and **20703-2B-LON-CL1-A**.


 For on-premises VM environments only, start  **MT17B-WS2016-NAT**, which is used to provide Internet access for the VMs.

 To complete this lab successfully, you must have completed Module 1 Lab A, "Preparing for cloud integration."


## Exercise 1: Signing up for an Office 365 trial subscription
  
### Scenario
  
 Your first step in deploying and managing the Office 365 client applications is to sign up for an Office 365 trial subscription. This will allow you to assign licenses to specific users and to configure the cloud-based deployment method for the applications.
